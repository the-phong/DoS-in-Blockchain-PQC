# Architectural decision log

## Phase 03C physical storage decision (2026-10-24; accepted by Owner)

**D-024 — Isolated B0 V2 complete-snapshot persistence (Accepted by Owner on
2026-10-24).** Use a separate Pebble database directory selected by an
explicit caller. Store one complete versioned record at key
`pluto/committed-state/v2` as
`ASCII("PLUTOS2!") || canonical_logical_state_v2 || AppHashV2[32]`, replacing
it with one `DB.Set(key, value, pebble.Sync)` per committed block. Opening
validates the entire record, V2 version, chain context, account invariants
and recomputed hash; the existing V1 key fails closed. Fresh initialization requires an absent
directory and canonical Genesis V2. Alternatives: multi-key atomic batch,
per-account updates, implicit migration of V1 data. A single record makes
the commit boundary and corruption checks simple, at O(K) serialization,
hashing and write cost for K accounts. A returned write error can leave the
durable outcome uncertain; the store does not promote in-memory state and
requires close/reopen validation before another candidate. This decision
does not claim physical power-loss durability from graceful restart tests.
The existing Phase 02 store and live ABCI path are unchanged. **Status:
ACCEPTED BY OWNER on 2026-10-24**, strictly as a correctness-oriented
experimental B0 baseline after Controller acceptance of Phase 03C, the R1
correction and the [risk addendum](evidence/phase_03c/RISK_AND_ACCEPTANCE_ADDENDUM.md).
Full-snapshot serialization, hashing and persistence cost O(K). Pluto and
CometBFT have no shared atomic commit. Production-grade or arbitrary-power-loss
durability has not been established, and B0 V2 cross-store crash recovery
remains unverified. Any later persistence-architecture change requires an
explicit, separately versioned decision and appropriate tests. This decision
does not merge PR #6, activate live B0 transactions or authorize Phase 03D.

## Phase 03B dependency decision (2026-10-23; Accepted by Owner)

**D-023 — Stateless secp256k1 adapter dependency (Accepted by Owner on 2026-10-23).** Select
`github.com/decred/dcrd/dcrec/secp256k1/v4 v4.4.1` as the direct dependency
for Phase 03B's compressed-point parsing, ECDSA verification over an already
computed 32-byte digest, and deterministic test-only signing. It was already
in the Phase 03A graph indirectly at v4.4.0; this is an explicit, reviewed
update to v4.4.1, not a silent upgrade. The module's minimum Go version is
1.17, below Pluto's 1.24.0. The module declares one direct dependency,
`github.com/decred/dcrd/crypto/blake256 v1.1.0`, already present in Pluto's
module graph; `go mod tidy` introduced no new module path. Module zip checksum:
`h1:5RVFMOWjMyRy8cARdy79nAmgYw3hK/4HUq48LQ6Wwqo=`. Its
`ModNScalar.SetByteSlice` reduces on overflow, so Pluto rejects overflow and
zero **before** using the scalar for ECDSA; it also checks low-S explicitly.
The public-key parser accepts other encodings at other lengths, so Pluto
enforces exactly 33 bytes and prefix 02/03 before parsing. Alternatives:
retain indirect v4.4.0; add a different secp256k1 stack; implement curve
arithmetic locally. v4.4.1 is the latest version listed by the Go module
index at selection time and supports the required prehashed ECDSA API.
This adapter is isolated from the Phase 02 ABCI runtime. D-020–D-022 remain
unchanged and accepted. The Owner accepted this exact dependency selection on
2026-10-23 after Controller acceptance and the merge of Phase 03B PR #4 at
`8be07c87abed73763d40252e99bbf0573da487b4`. This acceptance does not
authorize Phase 03C or change the accepted B0 V1 protocol.

## Phase 03A B0 V1 protocol decisions (2026-10-23; accepted by owner)

The owner authorized specification work and, after Controller R1–R5 rework,
explicitly **accepted D-020, D-021 and D-022 as B0 V1 protocol rules** on
2026-10-23. Their exact rules, alternatives and rationale are in
`research/specs/` and the Phase 03A report. Acceptance does not mean the
protocol is implemented or cryptographically tested. The Owner controls
Draft PR #3's merge; Phase 03B requires separate authorization after merge.

**D-020 — B0 classical transaction V1 (Accepted by Owner).** Select a fixed binary,
versioned, chain-bound value-transfer wire format with compressed secp256k1
public key, `uint64` amount/nonce, compact low-S ECDSA signature, SHA-256
domain-separated signed intent, SHA-256-derived 20-byte account address and
separate domain-separated TxID. Alternatives considered: Ethereum transaction
encoding/address rules, DER signatures, an independent sender-address field,
fees/gas/memo/expiry fields and variable-length encodings. Rationale: a small
unambiguous B0 correctness baseline with one sender identity. Trade-offs:
fee-free operation has no economic spam deterrent; addresses are not Ethereum
compatible; future fields require a new version. The controller rework fixes
cheap-rejection precedence: structural checks, chain match, positive amount
and canonical signature scalars precede point validation/ECDSA. A matching
sender nonce of `MaxUint64` fails Code 6 before balance checks. Pluto TxID
exists exactly for structurally valid V1 wire with in-range low-S scalars,
even if its key, signature, chain or state is invalid; CometBFT RPC instead
uses SHA-256 of raw transaction bytes. Status: **Accepted by Owner on
2026-10-23 for future separately authorized implementation**. Verification:
no transaction bytes or cryptographic vectors were generated or executed in
Phase 03A.

**D-021 — B0 account state and AppHash V2 (Accepted by Owner).** Select checked
`uint64` balances, nonces and supply, sorted 20-byte accounts, sequential
value transfers, no fees/mint/burn, and a SHA-256 commitment to version,
chain ID, height, supply and all accounts. New B0 chains use canonical V2
genesis bytes; Phase 02 V1 homes have no implicit migration. Alternatives:
Merkle/trie state root, account deletion, automatic migration and unordered
storage hashing. Rationale: independently reproducible state transitions
before optional EVM work. Trade-offs: flat commitment has no account proof
and may be costly at scale; physical atomic persistence is future Phase 03C
work. Full-state recomputation is proportional to account count; B0/B1
measurements must control account count and execution model. Status:
**Accepted by Owner on 2026-10-23 for future separately authorized
implementation**. Verification: specification review
and arithmetic/length checks only; no V2 state exists in code.

**D-022 — B0 ABCI validity policy (Accepted by Owner).** Select conservative
committed-state `CheckTx`, deterministic sequential validation of the full
proposal in `ProcessProposal`, and one ordered result per decided transaction
in `FinalizeBlock`, with invalid decided transactions skipped without state
effect. Keep pending state until synced `Commit`. Alternatives: trusting local
admission, accepting all proposals, or aborting finalization on ordinary bad
transaction bytes. Rationale: independent proposer-injection defense and
deterministic fallback without unnecessary application halt. Trade-offs:
strict proposal rejection may cost rounds under bad proposers; the anomalous
decided-block fallback and fixed count/byte limits require implementation and
multi-validator validation before operational claims.
The shared evaluator now explicitly uses cheap structural/amount/scalar checks
before ECDSA, rejects nonce overflow as Code 6, and distinguishes Pluto TxID
eligibility from CometBFT's raw-byte RPC hash. Block-limit fixtures require
otherwise valid signed and funded sequential transactions.
Status: **Accepted by Owner on 2026-10-23 for future separately authorized
implementation**. Verification: pinned v0.38.26 interface review only;
current Phase 02 runtime still rejects all transactions.

## Phase 02R approved governance and roadmap decisions (2026-10-23)

**D-018 — Phase-Based Git Governance.** Context: D-011 correctly records the
owner's local-only exception for Phase 02, but Phase 02R has an explicit new
Git workflow. Alternatives: continue local checksums only; commit directly
to an integration branch; one isolated branch and Draft PR per authorized
phase. Selected: branch from the verified `origin/test-mainet` baseline,
commit and push only approved-scope changes to the phase branch, and open a
Draft PR targeting `test-mainet`. The owner performs or explicitly approves
merges; agents never merge automatically, push directly to `test-mainet` or
`master`, rewrite shared history, or infer a new phase from a PASS verdict.
The Coding Agent reports to the ChatGPT technical controller in English;
the controller communicates decisions to the owner in Vietnamese. Each
execution ends with evidence, a full report and STOP. Rationale: reviewable
history and controlled integration. Risks: branch protection may be absent;
Git authentication and an authorized existing author identity are required.
Status: **Accepted by owner for Phase 02R and future separately authorized
phases**, superseding D-011 prospectively only. D-011 and its checksum
evidence remain historically true. Verification: Phase 02R records the
remote source SHA, branch, resulting commit and Draft PR or exact blocker.

**D-019 — B0-Core First, EVM Decision at Phase 04.** Context: the earlier
14-phase plan assumed EVM was mandatory before hybrid work. Alternatives:
integrate EVM unconditionally before B0-Core; complete B0-Core first and
decide whether EVM is needed at Phase 04. Selected: Phase 03A–03E build and
validate the minimal classical B0-Core, including single-node and
four-validator validation, before Phase 04. Phase 04 records a separate
research and implementation decision; sequential EVM integration occurs
only if approved. A no-go is not a permanent rejection of EVM. Rationale:
establish a smaller correctness baseline and avoid adding unneeded execution
complexity before the research need is known. Risks: a later EVM decision may
require additional state/transaction mapping and migration work. Status:
**Accepted by owner as Master Roadmap v2 planning**; no Phase 03A or Phase 04
implementation is authorized. Verification: roadmap, architecture, status
and manifest state B0-Core-first and conditional EVM; later gate records the
actual go/no-go and evidence. D-004 and D-006 remain historical candidate
and conditional sequential-execution guidance.

## Phase 02 accepted decisions (2026-10-15)

**D-011 — Local baseline replaces Git checkpoint.** Context: user chose local
development without Git identity, commits, branches or remote. Alternatives:
Git baseline; no traceability; SHA-256 file manifest. Selected: checksums of
the 16 existing nonsecret source/config/documentation files in
`research/evidence/phase_02/BASELINE_SHA256.txt`, generated and verified before
Phase 02 edits. Rationale: reproducible Phase 01 checkpoint without invented
identity. Risk: no history/diff machinery; preserve original report/evidence
and use this manifest plus the Phase 02 report. Status: **Accepted** by user.
Verification: `sha256sum -c` passed at baseline; the old commit requirement was
superseded, never fulfilled.

**D-012 — CometBFT v0.38.26.** Context: v1.0.0 was only a historical candidate.
Alternatives: v1.0.0, v0.38.26, v0.40.0. Selected: exact v0.38.26, pinned in
`go.mod` and built as `build/cometbft`; module checksum retained in `go.sum`.
Rationale: v1.0.0 is affected by published ASA-2025-001/002; the 0.38 line
has patches for [ASA-2025-003][asa003] (0.38.19) and
[CSA-2026-001 Tachyon][tachyon] (0.38.21); v0.38.26 is later than these fixes.
v0.40.0 requires Go 1.25, above local Go 1.24.1. v0.38.26 declares Go
1.22.11. Trade-offs: v0.38's ABCI API differs from Phase 01's v1.0.0
reference; security is not proven merely by a patched version or build.
Status: **Accepted for Phase 02 local development**. Verification: module
download, `go build`, actual ABCI integration, live block production and
restart; [release][comet038release], [ASA-2025-001][asa001],
[ASA-2025-002][asa002], [ASA-2025-003][asa003], [Tachyon][tachyon].

**D-013 — Separate pinned CometBFT child and Pluto ABCI socket.** Context:
need a real node with small integration surface. Alternatives: in-process node;
external arbitrary binary; bundled exact-version child. Selected: `plutod`
starts its adjacent `cometbft` binary and a localhost ABCI socket server.
Rationale: CometBFT's own init/node CLI gives valid validator configuration,
while Pluto owns application lifecycle. Trade-offs: two processes and startup
coordination; no public bindings by default. Status: **Accepted**. Verified by
live RPC and restart integration test.

**D-014 — Pebble v1.1.5 and commit boundary.** Context: durable minimal state.
Alternatives: Pebble, flat file atomic rename, SQL. Selected: exact Pebble
v1.1.5, one versioned state key, `Set(..., pebble.Sync)` only in `InitChain`
for genesis and `Commit` for blocks. `FinalizeBlock` remains memory-only.
Rationale: single-key atomicity, synced WAL, exclusive writable directory;
also the provisional version reviewed in Phase 01. Trade-offs: no general
multi-key transaction or arbitrary-power-loss proof; CometBFT/application
cross-store atomicity relies on ABCI replay. Status: **Accepted**. Verified by
reload, finalize-without-commit, exclusive-open and restart tests; storage
version is pinned in `go.mod`.

**D-015 — Canonical state digest.** Context: deterministic Phase 02 AppHash.
Alternatives: JSON hash, Merkle tree, fixed binary SHA-256. Selected: SHA-256
with `PLUTO/APP_STATE/V1` NUL-terminated domain, big-endian version, chain-ID
length and bytes, and height; versioned persisted record with recomputation on
reload. Empty blocks advance height and hash. Rationale: portable and
testable, no unordered maps. Trade-off: not an Ethereum trie root and must be
versioned when adding state. Status: **Accepted**. Verified by canonical
encoding tests and two-instance deterministic replay.

**D-016 — Genesis and node configuration.** Context: reproducible developer
chain. Alternatives: hand-written validator/genesis; CometBFT init. Selected:
bundled `cometbft init`, validated chain ID, initial height 1, empty app
state, generated single validator, localhost listeners and one-second empty
blocks. Init refuses an existing home; start checks Pluto metadata against
genesis. Trade-offs: generated private keys require protection; port collision
and file-system errors still require operator intervention. Status:
**Accepted**. Verified by live init/start, RPC and restart test.

**D-017 — Out-of-scope transactions.** Context: Phase 02 has no transaction
semantics. Alternatives: accept no-op txs; reject all. Selected: `CheckTx`
code 1, empty proposer output, deterministic proposal rejection for nonempty
txs, `FinalizeBlock` error if they somehow reach it. Rationale: fail closed,
never claim execution. Trade-off: no workload submission until Phase 03.
Status: **Accepted**. Verified by ABCI lifecycle tests.

## Historical Phase 01 decisions (future candidates superseded where noted)

Decision status describes authorization for this foundation, not experimental
validation. `Accepted` decisions apply in Phase 01; future integration details
remain `Proposed`. Changing an accepted decision requires a new dated entry
with a reason and verification plan. Observations were made on 2026-10-15.

## D-001 — Go application language

- **Context:** A new custom CometBFT application needs a maintainable systems
  language and reproducible modules.
- **Alternatives:** Go; Rust with an ABCI bridge; a framework in another language.
- **Selected:** Go module with a declared Go 1.24.0 minimum; observed local
  toolchain is Go 1.24.1 on linux/amd64.
- **Rationale:** Direct access to candidate CometBFT and geth Go APIs with
  simple build/test tooling.
- **Risks/trade-offs:** The minimum may need adjustment after dependency
  integration; runtime and compiler versions affect later measurements.
- **Status:** Accepted for Phase 01.
- **Verification:** `go version`, `go build`, `go test`, and `go vet` are run in
  Phase 01; no future dependency combination is yet compiled.

## D-002 — CometBFT consensus foundation

- **Context:** The target research needs Byzantine fault tolerant ordering and
  ABCI++ application callbacks.
- **Alternatives:** CometBFT; another BFT engine; custom consensus.
- **Selected:** CometBFT, with v1.0.0 as the initial **provisional integration
  target**, matching the historical plan.
- **Rationale:** The [v1.0.0 ABCI++ methods][abci-methods] and
  [requirements][abci-requirements] explicitly describe the lifecycle under
  study. No consensus algorithm changes are permitted.
- **Risks/trade-offs:** Phase 02 must check API compatibility, security support,
  mempool configuration, liveness and replay behavior at the pinned tag. A
  newer patch line may be preferable after review; it must be recorded.
- **Status:** Accepted engine; exact version Proposed.
- **Verification:** Official release tag and module path
  `github.com/cometbft/cometbft` exist; v1.0.0 declares `go 1.23.1` in
  [go.mod][comet-mod]. No Pluto integration test exists.

## D-003 — Custom application, not Cosmos SDK

- **Context:** The study needs explicit transaction representation and
  application-level validation controls.
- **Alternatives:** Custom ABCI++ application; Cosmos SDK application.
- **Selected:** Custom Go application using CometBFT; no Cosmos SDK dependency.
- **Rationale:** Preserves a clear research boundary and avoids claiming SDK
  semantics or compatibility that do not exist.
- **Risks/trade-offs:** More state, RPC, and EVM integration work is owned by
  Pluto. Adoption of the SDK would require an explicit later decision.
- **Status:** Accepted.
- **Verification:** Phase 01 `go.mod` has no SDK dependency; future behavior is
  architectural, not verified.

## D-004 — EVM library boundary

- **Context:** The target chain requires EVM execution but not a new EVM.
- **Alternatives:** go-ethereum execution components; another EVM library;
  implementing EVM semantics from scratch.
- **Selected:** Propose go-ethereum v1.16.8 behind `internal/evm`, with a
  sequential baseline and explicit transaction-to-message mapping.
- **Rationale:** Historical reference version; official [release][geth-release]
  and [go.mod][geth-mod] are available. The tag declares `go 1.24.0`.
- **Risks/trade-offs:** Exact APIs, state root semantics, receipts, gas, fork
  rules, licensing and compatibility with the ABCI state model need testing.
- **Status:** Proposed for Phase 04; no dependency added in Phase 01.
- **Verification:** Module path `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum` and Go
  directive observed at tag. Combined build and execution are unverified.

## D-005 — Application storage and commitment

- **Context:** Durable state and deterministic AppHash are needed later.
- **Alternatives:** Pebble; another key/value engine; embedded SQL.
- **Selected:** Propose Pebble v1.1.5 as a candidate storage engine because
  geth v1.16.8 already requires that exact v1 module. Keep AppHash definition
  separate from engine selection.
- **Rationale:** Avoid an avoidable v1/v2 module split during first integration.
  Official [Pebble go.mod][pebble-mod] confirms module path
  `github.com/cockroachdb/pebble` and Go 1.20 directive.
- **Risks/trade-offs:** Pebble v1 lifecycle and geth's storage use need review;
  app-level atomicity, recovery and state commitment are unresolved. Pebble
  bytes alone are not an authenticated state root.
- **Status:** Proposed for later phases.
- **Verification:** Module metadata and geth requirement inspected; no Pluto
  storage code or crash test exists.

## D-006 — Sequential execution baseline

- **Context:** EVM parallelism would confound hybrid-authentication costs.
- **Alternatives:** Sequential execution; parallel scheduling from inception.
- **Selected:** Sequential EVM execution as the initial functional baseline.
- **Rationale:** Establishes an interpretable correctness oracle and comparable
  performance baseline before optimization.
- **Risks/trade-offs:** Limits initial throughput; implementation still needs
  deterministic state ordering and replay checks.
- **Status:** Accepted research constraint.
- **Verification:** No EVM exists yet; not experimentally verified.

## D-007 — Transaction format belongs to Pluto

- **Context:** Standard Ethereum raw transactions have no defined Pluto
  ML-DSA-44 authentication field.
- **Alternatives:** Custom versioned envelope; modify geth transaction types;
  pretend standard raw Ethereum RPC carries both proofs.
- **Selected:** Pluto will specify a versioned canonical application envelope
  and explicit RPC semantics in later protocol work.
- **Rationale:** Makes the signed intent and authentication policy auditable
  without claiming Ethereum wire compatibility.
- **Risks/trade-offs:** Wallet tooling and hash/receipt mapping require work;
  byte encoding, domain, replay protection and account binding are undecided.
- **Status:** Accepted ownership boundary; exact format Proposed.
- **Verification:** No encoding or signature code exists in Phase 01.

## D-008 — Dependency version policy

- **Context:** Experimental results must map to exact source revisions.
- **Alternatives:** Floating latest versions; early unused dependencies;
  pin dependencies when first imported.
- **Selected:** Use Go modules; add exact dependency versions only when used.
  Record candidates separately from actual `go.mod` requirements. Review
  releases, security advisories and toolchain constraints before adoption.
- **Rationale:** Phase 01 builds without network access and avoids a false
  appearance of tested compatibility.
- **Risks/trade-offs:** Candidate versions may change at their phase gate;
  comparisons must record the decision and migration.
- **Status:** Accepted.
- **Verification:** Phase 01 `go.mod` uses only the standard library and has no
  `go.sum`; `go mod verify` is run in the foundation check.

## D-009 — Reproducible research record

- **Context:** Correctness and cost claims require independent reproduction.
- **Alternatives:** Informal notes; versioned plan, manifest, evidence and
  phase reports.
- **Selected:** Version the plan, decisions, architecture, manifest and
  completion report. Later experiments must record commit, toolchain, flags,
  node configuration, hardware, workload seeds and raw results.
- **Rationale:** Separates observed facts from plans and preserves review gates.
- **Risks/trade-offs:** Manual metadata can drift; future tooling should
  generate and validate experiment manifests.
- **Status:** Accepted.
- **Verification:** Required documents and Phase 01 execution evidence will be
  reviewed at the phase gate; no experiment is claimed.

## D-010 — Cryptographic library candidate

- **Context:** Future hybrid authentication needs a FIPS 204-compatible
  ML-DSA-44 implementation and classical secp256k1 verification.
- **Alternatives:** CIRCL; another vetted ML-DSA implementation; new primitive
  implementation (disallowed). Geth's existing secp256k1 stack versus a
  separate library.
- **Selected:** Propose CIRCL v1.6.4 for later evaluation; use geth's existing
  secp256k1 dependency path where its API meets the protocol spec. Neither is
  imported now.
- **Rationale:** CIRCL documents an [ML-DSA-44 package][circl-mldsa], and
  [v1.6.4 go.mod][circl-mod] declares Go 1.24.0. [v1.6.5][circl-newer]
  declares Go 1.25.0,
  exceeding the installed toolchain. Geth v1.16.8 requires
  `github.com/decred/dcrd/dcrec/secp256k1/v4 v4.0.1`.
- **Risks/trade-offs:** FIPS mode, context handling, known-answer tests,
  serialization and constant-time properties need a later cryptographic
  review. A newer supported release may be selected with a toolchain change.
- **Status:** Proposed for Phase 06.
- **Verification:** The [ML-DSA-44 directory exists at v1.6.4][circl-tag-dir];
  package documentation and module metadata inspected. No crypto API
  compilation, vectors or security assessment performed.
