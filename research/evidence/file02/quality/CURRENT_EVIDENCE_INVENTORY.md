# File 02 current evidence inventory — G00.3 snapshot

Snapshot date: 2026-11-14. Q engineering source/result commit:
`f629b47c67dd75d929936a98aebf4617f513d108`. This is a source
inventory, not a new scientific result or Gate QUALITY acceptance. PR #28
is still Draft. The raw sessions remain in the ignored, private
`research/artifacts/file02/` tree; this inventory publishes identifiers and
hashes only.

The protocol tree OID covers all File 02 case plans, including the R, A and
Q locked plans; the config tree covers factors, metric definitions, artifact
templates and the manifest. Each private `plan.json` records its own source
commit, module hash and config hash where applicable. The accompanying
`qc_report.json` binds the exact plan and `raw/manifest.json` SHA-256.

## Run and QC locator

[DATA_PROVENANCE_INDEX.csv](DATA_PROVENANCE_INDEX.csv) lists 30 frozen
sessions and 1,063 result/session records: 974 rows have a real `run_id`,
87 benchmark/diagnostic result rows lack one and are identified by a
`result_per_run.json` row reference, and two aborted sessions have no
result rows. Every indexed session's QC plan and raw-manifest hashes matched
the local frozen files when generated. CSV SHA-256:
`ef1e651f2de94e0c9a4f01f15a1fc56093b06bfd84c1a527634567e6f990485a`.
Regenerate and check with `python3 research/tools/file02_provenance_index.py
write` and `python3 research/tools/file02_provenance_index.py check` from the
repository root. A matching manifest hash proves local byte consistency,
not that each session is inferentially eligible.

The Q02 pre-send abort (`q02-20261114T024019Z-8ccd9928`) remains invalid;
the first complete Q02 schedule (`q02-20261114T025508Z-a4b258cb`) remains
technically QC-PASS but superseded for cross-profile inference because its
arm order was confounded. Only corrected Q02 v2
(`q02-20261114T044327Z-e7f236e2`, manifest SHA-256
`58265e00a8c0fc08a37cb4e2935633d85304a1e70d32142df5d9eaa4d1180f3f`)
supports the current Q02 contrast. Two early R15 sessions remain
`INVALID_FOR_INFERENCE`; the final R15 session is bounded historical
evidence. The current R15 verifier reports plan drift because current
`go.mod` differs from the locked source commit; the historical module hash
and raw integrity are distinguished in [Q05](Q05_BOTTLENECK_DISPOSITION.md).

The CSV covers sessions with frozen QC reports. It does not fabricate
`run_id` rows for report-only or unsupported cases. Their dispositions remain
in [R05](../R05_VERIFY_ORDER_UNSUPPORTED.md),
[R11](../R11_P2P_PROPAGATION_DISPOSITION.md),
[R12](../R12_RPC_P2P_ORIGIN_UNSUPPORTED.md),
[R13](../R13_CACHE_DEDUP_DISPOSITION.md),
[A11](../A11_MATCHED_RESOURCE_DISPOSITION.md) and
[A12](../A12_MANY_PEER_UNSUPPORTED.md). A11 and Q05/Q06 are PARTIAL, while
R05/R12/A12 remain UNSUPPORTED under their respective case rules.

## Supported results and boundaries

- [RQ1 resource report](../RQ1_RESOURCE_REPORT.md): application CheckTx
  H−CP at 20 valid tx/s is +81.47 µs/tx, paired 95% CI
  [+75.16, +87.26] µs/tx. Same wire size does not identify crypto CPU alone.
- A01/A04/A05 report invalid CheckTx *wall* means 7.25/391.31/438.28
  µs/tx in different case networks; they are not a paired CPU comparison.
- [Q01](Q01_MATCHED_VALID_SERVICE_AUDIT.md), [Q02](Q02_ORDER_BALANCED_DECOMPOSITION_AUDIT.md)
  and [Q06](Q06_REPLICATION_DISPOSITION.md): the fixed legitimate H
  3-second first-all-four endpoint shows no loss in tested matched RPC
  strata. Original A-family effects and corrected Q02 structural DiD are
  0 [0,0], but the binary endpoint is ceiling-limited and cannot prove
  latency equivalence or absence of smaller effects.
- [A10](../A10_MATCHED_BYTES_AUDIT.md): validator-0 relay-send envelope
  means 1,853,280 B/run benign and 555,984 B/run attack; this is not a
  per-peer propagation-latency measurement.
- [Q07](Q07_NO_INVALID_ACCEPTED_AUDIT.md): 248 QC-passing RQ1b networks,
  38,600 valid exact-once commits and 20,496 invalid transactions absent
  from committed blocks; full-state replay and observed four-validator
  agreement passed within the stated oracle scope.
- [R15](../R15_BENIGN_CAPACITY_AUDIT.md): no knee observed at
  20/23/25 valid tx/s; 25 tx/s is the safety cap, not a capacity estimate.

The testbed has four Comet processes on one physical host; the application
shares the integration process, with validator-0 loopback RPC origin. The
100-ms scanner yields first-all-four *observation upper bounds*, not exact
commit timestamps. Q03 p99 inference, stage crypto CPU, full queue,
independent-host and P2P-origin claims remain unavailable. Q05/Q06 stay
PARTIAL; D01–D13 and ML remain NOT_RUN. No new X hypothesis or run is
authorized by this inventory.

## CI and verification snapshot

PR #28 checks: `scan` PASS, `smoke` PASS, and both `verify` jobs PASS.
The present Controller review independently reran Q01, Q02 v2, Q03,
Q04, Q06 and Q07 verifiers with exit code 0. Q03 reported 22/22 groups
`INSUFFICIENT_SAMPLES`; Q06 reported `PARTIAL_HOST_REPLICATION`.
The published index generator's hash check and tamper-rejection unit test
also passed. See the separate review record for disposition; the PR and
Gate have not been accepted or merged by this inventory.
